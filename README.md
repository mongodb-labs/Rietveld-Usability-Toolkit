## Tools:

Syntax Highlighting - Language specific syntax highlighting with multiple color schemes.

Expand All - Expand all matching lines in a side-by-side diff with one click or keystroke.

Inline Diffs - Open diffs inline, right on the issue page. Also adds useful buttons to open/close all diffs. Even better, inline diffs can have the column width set automatically based on file type.

Add Replace-specific Color - In side-by-side diff, color changed lines a different color to better distinguish between changes and deletes/insertions.

Rewrite Unified Diff Links - Nobody ever wants to see the unified diff, so rewrite those links to point to the side-by-side diff instead.

Better code fonts - Change the font to Inconsolata and adjust the font size to your liking.

Smarter Selection/Copy - Have you ever tried to copy code from a side-by-side diff? It's awful, you get both columns and all the line numbers. This tool fixes selection to only select the code in one column (and no line numbers).
